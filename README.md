This is a web project in which we have to counter that eiter increases, decreases a number by 1 or reset it to 0. 
Technologies Used : HTML, CSS, Javascript

Live Preview : https://prathamtrikha.github.io/Counter/
Instruction:-
It is very easy to use, in the web page we have three buttons-
1) Increase = after pressing this it will increase the value of the counter by 1.
2) Decrease = after pressing this it will decrease the value of the counter by 1.
3) Reset = after pressing no matter what the value is it will get reset to zero.

One more thing that I would like to tell is when Increase the number the color changes to green, when we decrease a number the color changes to red and when we reset it, the color changes to white.

Enjoy! with the counter...
